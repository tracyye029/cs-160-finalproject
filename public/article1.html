        <p style="font-size:30px;">Whether you’ve always been the family chef or are just learning to perfect your meal planning and cooking now while stuck at home, making your food go as far as possible can be a source of solace during this difficult time. With the stay-at-home measures in response to COVID-19—and with many of us tightening our budgets—there has been a renewed focus on creative, 
          cost-effective home cooking. Right now, millions of people are out of work. Many of these people are shopping with restricted budgets or facing food insecurity for the first time and are trying to find ways to make their food go further. For some, cooking can be a way to reduce stress, find peace, and connect more closely with family and friends through shared recipes.
          Though the unsettling news articles showing empty shelves at the grocery store and exceptionally long lines at food pantries illuminate the uncertainty of this time, there’s no need to panic shop. It is true that the COVID crisis has disrupted food supply chains, but buying more than you need only exacerbates the problem. It also contributes to food waste, a major 
          contributor to climate change. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends you buy only what you need until your next shopping trip. That advice, plus these simple tips to make that food stay good as long as possible, should help uplift your time in the kitchen.

        <p style="font-size:30px;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Introduce mindfulness into your shopping routine.</span>
          Saving food in your home starts with a mind-set change. It includes being intentional about your purchases and planning ahead for meals—which the Save the Food Meal Prep Mate can help you with. The basic premise is to outline a meal plan for the week, which will also minimize your time in the store. To start, consider what meals you will be making for the week, how many people need to be fed, 
          and what kind of leftovers you’d like. Then, check on what you’ve currently got in your freezer, pantry, and fridge to see what you can use up. Once you’ve planned your meals, determine how much food you will need and generate a shopping list. And once you’re at the store, exercise restraint—and use that list.
